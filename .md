      In order to find an easier way to create a new project, I wrote this shell script to easily create new folders and set up a github repo.


      I first started by writing some bash code in order to have all of the assets set into a folder that can be copied and made into a new project.
     
      This bash code is set by using mkdir to create a folder and using touch to go inside the folder.

     `#!/bin/bash
      # scafolds my project
      mkdir myfolder
      touch myfolder/index.html
      cd myfolder`

   Inside the folder, files are created and touched in order to work inside of them.
` mkdir css js img
touch css/style.css
touch js/page.js
touch readme.md`

  Once inside the HTML, a basic boiler plate is set up in order to quickly create projects that are ready to be edited into websites. This basic boiler plate sets up the size of the site, adds a basic structure, and then links the css and js files.

`echo "<h1>hello, world</h1>" >> index.html
echo "<!DOCTYPE html>" >> index.html
echo "<html lang="en">" >> index.html
echo  "<head>" >> index.html
echo   "<meta charset="UTF-8">" >> index.html
echo   "<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">" >> index.html
echo    "<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">" >> index.html
echo    "<title>title</title>" >> index.html
echo    "<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">" >> index.html
echo  "</head>" >> index.html
echo  "<body>" >> index.html
echo   " <main>" >> index.html
echo        "<h1>Title</h1> " >> index.html
echo    "</main>" >> index.html
echo  "<script src="data.js"></script>" >> index.html
echo  "<script src="main.js"></script>" >> index.html
echo "    <h1>If this is red, it's working.</h1>" >> index.html
echo "  </body>" >> index.html
echo "</html>" >> index.html
echo "h1 {color:red;}" >> styles/style.css
echo  "</body> " >> index.html
echo "</html>" >> index.html


echo "body {">> css/style.css
echo "font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif:" >>css/style.css
echo "font-size: 1rem:" >>css/style.css
echo "}" >> css/style.css
echo "h1 {color:red;}" >> css/style.css


code index.html
code modern-normalize.css
code css/style.css`

Using this shell script, you are able to put it into your terminal and quickly create new projects.
